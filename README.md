# isochrone_fitting

This Python script was produced in the context of the C2PU (Centre Pédagogique Planète Univers) module of the MAUCA (Master track in Astrophysics in Université Côte d'Azur). The goal was to extract relevant data from globular cluster (GC) NGC 869 using the Topcat software: the G magnitude and the R magnitude, using the correction from the Gaia DR2 catalog. We were then able to display the color-magnitude diagram (CMD, G VS (G-R)) of NGC 689 and fit isochrones from the Parsec website (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd) to estimate the age of the GC.
